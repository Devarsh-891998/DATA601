    "Second, please read this entire notebook. I will not grade this homework, I just want your honest feedback (see Q4) <br>\n",

    "to examine it and do any necessary data cleaning. Descriptions of the columns (in order) present in this csv file are as follows\n",
    "- rating: the average rating on a 1-5 scale achieved by the book\n",
    "- review_count: the number of Goodreads users who reviewed this book\n",
    "- isbn: the ISBN code for the book\n",
    "- booktype: an internal Goodreads identifier for the book\n",
    "- author_url: the Goodreads (relative) URL for the author of the book\n",
    "- year: the year the book was published\n",
    "- genre_urls: a string with '|' separated relative URLS of Goodreads genre pages\n",
    "- dir: a directory identifier internal to the scraping code\n",
    "- rating_count: the number of ratings for this book (this is different from the number of reviews)\n",
